# Test Coverage Improvement Workflow

## Objective
Improve overall test coverage to minimum 100% for the entire repository.

## Current Status
- **Overall Coverage**: Current test coverage metrics showing gaps across the codebase
- **Failed Tests**: Tests currently failing that need to be resolved
- **Target Coverage**: ≥100% across all metrics (statements, branches, functions, lines)

## Coverage Analysis
| File Type | Current Coverage | Target Coverage | Priority |
|-----------|------------------|-----------------|----------|
| Source Files | Variable | 100% | High |
| Component Files | Variable | 100% | High |
| Utility Files | Variable | 100% | Medium |
| Configuration Files | Variable | 100% | Medium |

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Fix Existing Test Issues
**Priority**: Critical
- [ ] Resolve all failing tests
- [ ] Fix component import/export mismatches
- [ ] Update mock implementations to match actual behavior
- [ ] Add proper error handling tests
- [ ] Fix test timeout and cleanup issues

### Phase 2: Achieve Complete Coverage
**Priority**: High
- [ ] Identify all uncovered code paths
- [ ] Create tests for missing functionality
- [ ] Add edge case and boundary condition tests
- [ ] Test all error scenarios and exception handling
- [ ] Verify all conditional branches are covered
- [ ] Test all utility functions and helpers

### Phase 3: Integration and Interaction Tests
**Priority**: Medium
- [ ] Add component interaction tests
- [ ] Test data flow between components
- [ ] Test routing and navigation
- [ ] Add user workflow tests
- [ ] Test API integrations and data fetching
- [ ] Add accessibility compliance tests

### Phase 4: Test Quality and Performance
**Priority**: Medium
- [ ] Organize tests with proper structure
- [ ] Create reusable test utilities and fixtures
- [ ] Optimize test execution performance
- [ ] Add comprehensive test documentation
- [ ] Implement test data management strategies

### Phase 5: Coverage Enforcement
**Priority**: High
- [ ] Configure coverage thresholds in test configuration
- [ ] Set up pre-commit hooks for coverage validation
- [ ] Integrate coverage reporting in CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Create coverage badges and monitoring
- [ ] Block merges that reduce coverage below 100%

### Phase 6: Maintenance and Monitoring
**Priority**: Ongoing
- [ ] Monitor coverage trends daily/weekly
- [ ] Set up regression alerts
- [ ] Regular coverage audits
- [ ] Update test coverage as new code is added
- [ ] Maintain test quality standards

## Implementation Timeline

### Week 1: Critical Fixes
- [ ] Resolve all failing tests
- [ ] Fix import/export issues
- [ ] Establish baseline coverage metrics

### Week 2: Core Coverage
- [ ] Achieve 100% coverage for high-priority files
- [ ] Add missing unit tests
- [ ] Test edge cases and error handling

### Week 3: Integration & Quality
- [ ] Add integration tests
- [ ] Improve test organization and performance
- [ ] Set up coverage enforcement

### Week 4: Automation & Monitoring
- [ ] Configure CI/CD coverage integration
- [ ] Set up monitoring and alerting
- [ ] Validate 100% coverage target

## Success Metrics
- [ ] Overall test coverage ≥100%
- [ ] Zero failing tests
- [ ] All files have ≥100% coverage
- [ ] Coverage enforcement in CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Test execution time <5 minutes
- [ ] <2% test flakiness rate

## Configuration Example
```json
{
  "jest": {
    "collectCoverage": true,
    "coverageThreshold": {
      "global": {
        "statements": 100,
        "branches": 100,
        "functions": 100,
        "lines": 100
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Quick Action Checklist
1. **Analyze**: Run coverage report to identify gaps
2. **Fix**: Resolve failing tests and import issues
3. **Cover**: Add tests for uncovered code paths
4. **Validate**: Ensure 100% coverage is achieved
5. **Enforce**: Set up automated coverage checks
6. **Monitor**: Track coverage trends and regressions

## Summary
This workflow provides a systematic approach to achieve 100% test coverage across the entire repository. The strategy focuses on fixing existing issues first, then systematically adding coverage for all code paths, followed by implementing enforcement and monitoring to maintain the target. The 4-week timeline ensures steady progress while the checklist provides clear actionable steps for immediate implementation.
